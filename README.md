# Diabetes Prediction End-to-End ML Project using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project involves building an end-to-end machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on certain medical measurements. The model is created using **Logistic Regression**, one of the most effective techniques for binary classification problems.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Using Logistic Regression to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.
- **Web Application**: A Flask web app that allows users to input new data and get predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**. It contains medical diagnostic measurements from 768 female patients, with the goal of predicting whether a patient is diabetic.

### Features:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin
- `BMI`: Body mass index
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Outcome`: 1 if diabetic, 0 if not
